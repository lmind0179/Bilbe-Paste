# Bible Paste (iPadOS)

Bible Paste automatically transforms copied Bible references (like “John 3:16”) into full Bible verses. It also offers a powerful interface for reading and searching the scriptures across multiple translations on your iPad.

## Highlights
- **Clipboard Auto-Convert:** Copy a reference from any app, and paste the actual verses, formatted according to your custom rules.
- **Read View:** Compare 1–4 translations side-by-side in columns. Easily adjust the font size and tap to copy any verse.
- **Search View:** Find any word or phrase and see parallel results across all your chosen translations, with search terms highlighted.
- **Flexible Formatting:** Customize your copied verses with wrappers (e.g.,『』), scope position (e.g., [John 3:16]), line breaks, verse number styles, and show/hide version names.
- **Smooth UX:** Navigate instantly between Read, Search, and Settings using the tab bar. Toolbar controls provide quick access to font size, column layouts, and version selection.

## Requirements
- iPadOS 16 or later
- For the auto-convert feature to work seamlessly, the app requires the "Paste from Other Apps" permission to be set to "Allow" in the iPad's Settings.

## Quick Start
1) Open the app and tap the **Read** tab at the bottom of the screen.
2) In the search bar at the top, type a book and chapter (e.g., "John 3", "Gen 1"), then tap the 'search' key on the keyboard.
   - Valid inputs for John 1 include: “Jhn 1”, “John 1”, “John1” (and localized names like “요1”, “요한복음 1”).
3) Use the arrow buttons in the top toolbar to navigate between chapters. Use the other toolbar icons to adjust font size, the number of columns, and the Bible versions displayed.
4) Tap the copy icon next to any verse to copy it to your clipboard with your custom formatting rules.
5) Tap the **Search** tab. Enter a word or phrase (e.g., “love”, “God so loved”) and tap the 'search' key.

## Settings (Formatting & Display)
- Choose primary and secondary versions (up to 3 for clipboard auto-convert, up to 4 for the Read/Search views).
- Toggle version name display, per-version line breaks, verse wrappers (e.g.,『』), scope position (before/after verse), chapter/verse numbering, and bracket styles.
- Set separate display preferences for the Read and Search views (font size, columns, and selected versions).
- “Reset Settings” returns all formatting options to their default state.

## Privacy
- Clipboard content is processed locally on your device and is never stored or transmitted.
- The app includes no analytics, tracking, or remote storage of any user data.
- App settings are stored locally on your iPad.

## Data and Copyright
- Bible texts are based on public-domain sources (e.g., KRV, KJV).
