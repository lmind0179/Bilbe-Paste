# Bible Paste (macOS)

Bible Paste turns Bible references in text (e.g., “John 3:16”) into real verses and lets readers compare multiple translations side‑by‑side with fast reading and search.

## Highlights
- Clipboard auto-convert: copy a reference, paste the actual verses with your formatting rules.
- Read view: compare 1–4 translations in columns, adjust font size, copy any verse.
- Search view: find words/phrases and see parallel results across translations.
- Flexible formatting: wrappers, range position, line breaks, verse number brackets, show/hide version name.
- Smooth UX: toolbar controls for font/columns/versions, menu bar access to Read, Search, Settings, Guide, Info.
